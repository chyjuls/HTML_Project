    <h1> About me...</h1>
    <img src="image\chy1.jpg" alt="This is me" style="height: 400px; width: 300px;">

        <p> 
        My full name is Chinyere Ugorji, but friends and colleagues know me as Chichi.
        I currently work within the healthcare sector but have a passion for all things technology,
        which influenced to a large extent, my decision to pursue a course in Diagnostic radiography.
        At that time I was interested in patient care as well as technology and sought to integrate both.
        In current times, my passion for technology has outweighed my love for healthcare,
        although I know based on current projections there is a place for technology in medicine and healthcare.
        I have done some self-learning in the different aspects of information technology and have been overwhelmed
        at the diversity within the industry.

    <h1>My Tech Journey…..</h1>
<p>
    I started out with hardware, 
    having taken exams in CompTIA networking and Microsoft’s 
    foundation exams in networking. I have dipped in and out of databases, 
    data analytics, business analysis and project management, which left me confused for a while 
    until I stumbled on a personality test online, which showed that I liked taking up new challenges. 
    The personality test also showed I was a problem solver. This helped me evaluate and stream line my choices, 
    with regards to a career in information technology.

        Women in Cyber Academy in Focus.
</h1>
<p>
    I have finally decided to choose the Cybersecurity path. 
    To help me understand more, I did some research online and did some free and paid online courses in Cybersecurity. 
    Some of this courses cost me a lot of money and some of the course providers 
    I figured, were only after my money. Then I heard about Women in Cyber academy. 
</p>
<li>My journey with WIC (Women in Cyber academy), 
    thus began this year after a phone interview.
     So far my journey towards fulfil my dream is on course and I must say, 
     I am enjoying every moment of it. I have given myself to learning programing and have been watching videos on end. I hope that one day, I will use my skills to make an immense contribution to the healthcare industry.</li>
