        <p> 
        My full name is Chinyere Ugorji, but friends and colleagues know me as Chichi.<br>
        I currently work within the healthcare sector but have a passion for all things technology,
        which influenced to a large extent, my decision to pursue a course in Diagnostic radiography.<br>
        At that time I was interested in patient care as well as technology and sought to integrate both.<br>
        In current times, my passion for technology has outweighed my love for healthcare,
        although I know based on current projections there is a place for technology in medicine and healthcare.<br>
        I have done some self-learning in the different aspects of information technology and have been overwhelmed
        at the diversity within the industry.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1>My Tech Journey…..</h1>
<p>
    I started out with hardware, 
    having taken exams in CompTIA networking and Microsoft’s 
    foundation exams in networking. <br>
    I have dipped in and out of databases(SQL), 
    data analytics, business analysis and project management, <br>
    this left me confused for a while 
    until I stumbled on a personality test online, which showed that I liked taking up new challenges. <br>
    The personality test also showed I was a problem solver. <br>This helped me evaluate and stream-line my choices, 
    with regards to a career in information technology.
</p>


    <h1>Women in Cyber Academy in Focus.</h1>
   
<p>
    I have finally decided to choose the Cybersecurity path. 
    To help me understand more, I did some research online and did some free and paid online courses in Cybersecurity. 
    Some of this courses cost me a lot of money and some of the course providers 
    I figured, were only after my money. Then I heard about Women in Cyber academy. 
</p>

<p>My journey with WIC (Women in Cyber academy), 
    thus began this year after a phone interview.
     So far my journey towards fulfilling my dream is on course and I must say, 
     I am enjoying every moment of it. I have given myself to learning programing and have been watching videos on end. 
     I hope that one day, I will use my skills to make an immense contribution to the healthcare industry.
    </p>
    
    <h1>What I love doing apart from work and study.</h1>
    <p>
        I have a passion for life, well for living, and so I have a few hobbies outside
        work. I love nature and so on days when I feel stressed or anxious, I take a long  walk,
        in the woods, or the park. 
        <br> This helps me clear my head, while enjoying the 
        green scenery.
        <p>
            I love a good laugh with friends, being a foodie, I love to go out, for meals
            with friends and enjoy a tasty cuisine(I am not fussy with food and like to try, all-sorts).<br>
        </p>

        <p> On days I feel like being lazy, I watch a good TV show on Netflix or Amazon Prime.<br>
            I love a good supernatural drama, with twists and turns, and could do with a psychological thriller or two,
            on early winter nights.<br>
            I am also a big fan of periodic and medivial drama!
            </p>
<p>
    Lastly, I love singing, I love music and enjoy different genre. I love to think, I can sing.<br>
    As a matter of fact, I have been told I can sing, and have been in numerous choirs.<br>
    For some reason, I have not  had the inspiration to sing for a while now, and I do hope that one day,<br>
    I will be back to making good, soulful music.
